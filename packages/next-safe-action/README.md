> next-safe-action is a library that takes full advantage of the latest and greatest Next.js, React and TypeScript features, using Zod, to let you define typesafe Server Actions and execute them inside Client Components.

## Documentation

**Explore the documentation for version 5 of the library on [next-safe-action website](https://next-safe-action.dev).** âœ¨

## Next.js >= 14 vs 13

Server Actions are now a stable feature in React. For this reason, there were some internal breaking changes to the API, and so a new version of the library is required to prevent backward compatibility issues.

**You can continue to use `next-safe-action` version 4 for your Next.js 13 app:**

```bash
# For Next.js 13 apps
npm i next-safe-action@v4


# For Next.js >= 14 apps
npm i next-safe-action
```

Version 4.x.x of the library introduced some breaking changes to the API. Please check out the [v3 to v4 migration guide](https://next-safe-action.dev/docs/migration-from-v3-to-v4) on the website for more information.
